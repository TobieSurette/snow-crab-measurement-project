# Crab photos from the September 2023 in Western Cape Breton

File names are of the form `SEP2023_Crab066_dorsal.jpg` indicating the study tag (`SEP2023`) the crab number (`066` the 66th crab measured) and the orientation of the shot (`dorsal`or `ventral`).

Each photo contains:

- a single crab on its belly or back.
- a tag with the crab number
- a white square reference colour used for calibrating the colorimeter.

Tissue was added to absorb sea water in many of the photos.
