# Spring 2024 - Soft-shelled Crab from the Fishery

An observational study of mainly **soft-shelled** snow crab from the 2024 Area 12 fishery in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Samples were provided by volunteer fishermen and picked up by DFO Sicence staff at the wharf. 

## Objectives

1. Add soft-shelled snow crab from early in the year to observational measurement data and measure their external and material properties.
2. Characterize the observed differences between the new-shelled and old-shelled crab, and explore which types of measurements might be used to clearly distinguish between the two groups in the field.

## Measurements

- Standard measurements and observations (carapace and chela size, carapace condition, etc.).
- Durometer (chela).
- Colorimeter (chela and merus).
- Near-infrared field spectrometer (Tellspec NIR) (chela and merus).
- Photos (ventral and dorsal, chela time permitting).
- Hemolymph sample for total protein content using refractometer.
- Meat content (from crab leg samples brought to the lab).

## Data set


## Issues

- It would have been nice to have hard-shelled crab samples along with the soft-shelled samples, but these are landed and sold by the fishermen.
