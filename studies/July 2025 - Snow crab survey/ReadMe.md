# Snow crab survey 2025 - Southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence

During the 2025 snow crab survey, from July 9th to September 17th, which takes place in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, a set of 367 crabs were photographed.

## Objectives

1. Sample larger male shell condition 2 and 3 crab at each location. Legs were frozen to provide a meat analysis to help in separating new and old-shelled crab. Photos of each crab sampled were taken.
2. Characterize the observed differences between the new-shelled and old-shelled crab, and explore which types of measurements might be used to clearly distinguish between the two groups in the field.

## Measurements

- Standard measurements and observations (carapace and chela size, carapace condition, etc.).
- Colorimeter (chela).
- Photos (whole crab, ventral and dorsal).

## Data set

A set of 367 male crabs were measured, all male snow crab larger than 90 millimeters carapace width. At each survey tow, one crab per shell condition category were photographed and measured with a colorimeter.

## Issues

- The colorimeter measurements were not made using the usual L*a*b scale, but rather some other scale.
