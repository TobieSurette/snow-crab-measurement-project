# September 2023 - Western Cape Breton 

An observational study was conducted on board the CCGS M. Perley from September 4th to the 11th, 2023, off the coast of Cheticamp, Cape Breton. Male snow crab, stratified by size, maturity and carapace condition were measured. 

## Objectives

1. Gather an exploratory dataset on individual snow crab which contains traditional observables, as well as new observables made with new devices measuring other material properties of snow crab.
2. Characterize the observed differences between the new-shelled and old-shelled crab, and explore which types of measurements might be used to clearly distinguish between the two groups in the field.

## Measurements

- Standard measurements and observations (carapace and chela size, carapace condition, etc.).
- Durometer (chela).
- Colorimeter (chela and merus).
- Near-infrared field spectrometer (Tellspec NIR) (chela and merus).
- Photos (ventral and dorsal, chela time permitting).
- Meat content (from samples brought to the lab).
- Hemolymph sample for total protein content using refractometer.

## Data set

An initial data set of about 70 crabs were measured and a further 20 or so crabs were frozen for later measurement in the lab.

## Issues

- When measuring, the Tellspec NIR was protected with either a plastic film (e.g. Saran Wrap) or a small transparent plastic disk. What type of protective film was used is contained in the the `protection` variable. Different platics are likely to affect the absorption spectra in different ways.
