## Objectives

1. Gather a representative sample of crab throughout the southern Gulf dataset on individual snow crab which contains traditional observables, as well as new observables made with new devices measuring other material properties of snow crab.
2. Characterize the observed differences between the new-shelled and old-shelled crab, and explore which types of measurements might be used to clearly distinguish between the two groups in the field.

## Measurements

- Standard measurements and observations (carapace and chela size, carapace condition, etc.).
- Colorimeter (chela).
- Photos (ventral and dorsal, chela time permitting).

## Data set

An initial data set of about 1003 male crabs were measured.

## Issues

- The colorimeter measurements were not made using the usual L*a*b scale, but rather some other scale.
