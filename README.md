# snow-crab-measurement-project

This project regroups various studies focusing intrumental measurement and characterization of snow crab material properties, such as carapace appearance and condition, meat content, morphometrics and maturity stages.  

## Background
Snow crab grow by periodically shedding their old, smaller, hard shell and forming a new, larger and soft shell, which subsequently hardens over time. With respect to managing the snow crab fishery, it is important to distinguish soft-shelled crab for two reasons: 

1. To quantify recruitment to the fishery, which is used for modeling the dynamics of the snow crab population and determining the status of the commercial stock. 
2. To estimate the quantity of soft-shelled crab being caught by fishermen. Soft-shelled crab are of no commercial value, but are vulnerable to mortality even when fishermen return them to the water. 

Currently, soft-shelled crab are distinguished using subjective external characteristics of the crab’s shell, such as colour, opacity, iridescence, or the quantity of surface organisms on the crab shell. Training and field testing is required to achieve the desired level of consistency between field samplers, with varying levels of success. Reliable identification is further complicated by variations in the external appearance of in different locations and over the field season. Thus, there is a need of a way to objectively distinguish between soft and hard-shelled crab in the field.
