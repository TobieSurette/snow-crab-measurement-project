Projects related to snow crab biological measurement tests. These may include carapace characteristics (hardness, colour, etc), moult stage, morphometrics and maturity stages.

## Background
A snow crab grows by periodically shedding its old, smaller, hard shell and forming a new, larger and soft shell, which then gradually hardens over time. With respect to managing the snow crab fishery, it is important to distinguish soft-shelled crab for two reasons: 

1.	To quantify growth rates for modeling the dynamics of the snow crab population and determine the status of the commercial stock. 
2.	To estimate the quantity of soft-shelled crab being caught by fishermen. High proportions of soft-shells can lead to local closures of the fishery in order to protect these vulnerable crab, which can then harden and be fished the following year.
   
Currently, soft-shelled crab are using a number of subjective external characteristics of the crabâ€™s shell, such as colour, opacity, iridescence, or the quantity of surface organisms on the crab shell. Training and field testing is required to achieve the desired level of consistency between field samplers, with varying levels of success. The task is further complicated by the fact that the external appearance of crab varies between different locations and over time, creating much uncertainty as to the reliability of these observations. Thus there is a need of a way objectively distinguish between soft and hard-shelled crab in the field.
