# snow-crab-measurement-project

This project regroups various studies focusing intrumental measurement and characterization of snow crab material properties, such as carapace appearance and condition, meat content, morphometrics and maturity stages.  

## Background
Snow crab grow by periodically shedding their old, smaller, hard shell and forming a new, larger and soft shell, which subsequently hardens over time. With respect to managing the snow crab fishery, it is important to distinguish soft-shelled crab for two reasons: 

1. To quantify recruitment to the fishery, which is used for modeling the dynamics of the snow crab population and determining the status of the commercial stock. 
2. To estimate the quantity of soft-shelled crab being caught by fishermen. Soft-shelled crab are of no commercial value, but are vulnerable to mortality even when fishermen return them to the water. 

Currently, soft-shelled crab are distinguished using subjective external characteristics of the crabâ€™s shell, such as colour, opacity, iridescence, or the quantity of surface organisms on the crab shell. Training and field testing is required to achieve the desired level of consistency between field samplers, with varying levels of success. Reliable identification is further complicated by variations in the external appearance of in different locations and over the field season. Thus, there is a need of a way to objectively distinguish between soft and hard-shelled crab in the field. 

# Studies

## September 2023 - Western Cape Breton 

An observational study was conducted on board the CCGS M. Perley from September 4th to the 11th, 2023, off the coast of Cheticamp, Cape Breton. Male snow crab, stratified by size, maturity and carapace condition were measured. 

### Objectives

1. Gather an exploratory dataset on individual snow crab which contains traditional observables, as well as new observables made with new devices measuring other material properties of snow crab.
2. Characterize the observed differences between the new-shelled and old-shelled crab, and explore which types of measurements might be used to clearly distinguish between the two groups in the field.

### Measurements

- Standard measurements and observations (carapace and chela size, carapace condition, etc.).
- Durometer (chela).
- Colorimeter (chela and merus).
- Near-infrared field spectrometer (Tellspec NIR) (chela and merus).
- Photos (ventral and dorsal, chela time permitting).
- Meat content (from samples brought to the lab).
- Hemolymph sample for total protein content using refractometer.

### Data set

An initial data set of about 70 crabs were measured and a further 20 or so crabs were frozen for later measurement in the lab.
