Photos from the September 2023 study aboard the CCGS Perley.
File names are of the form: 'SEP2023_CrabXXX_view.jpg' where XXX is the crab identification number (see SEP2023.xlsx file) and 'view' is either 'dorsal' or 'ventral', depending on whether the crab was flipped on its back or not.

Other photos in the directory are archival photos not from the September 2023 study.
